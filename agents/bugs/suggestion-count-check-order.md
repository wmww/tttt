# Spelling suggestions counted in check order: the deferred bodies are done, lazy type resolution isn't

tsc gives at most 10 "Did you mean" suggestions per checker (`suggestionCount` / `maximumSuggestionCount` in
`resolveNameHelper`'s lazy diagnostic), and the count increases for every name it fails to resolve, suggestion or not,
in the order the *checker* resolves names. tttt counts at the resolve shards' merge (`resolve_shard_merge`): since
the plan-52 drain it counts the top level first and then the bodies tsc defers (`checkNodeDeferred`: function
expressions, arrows, object literal methods and accessors, class expressions) breadth first (`ResolveShard.body_parent`,
`suggestion_count_order()`), which fixed jest's test files (`test(...)` calls at the top level get "Did you mean
'Test'?" before the `expect`s in their callbacks spend the budget).

Still different (angular-components `src/cdk/testing/testbed/task-state-zone-interceptor.ts`, -TS2552 in 3 projects):
tsc resolves type references lazily, when a type is first needed. There, line 36's initializer calls
`this._getTaskStateFromInternalZoneState(...)`, whose signature's parameter type `HasTaskState` (line 55) is resolved
then, before the method at line 48 is checked: tsc suggests 'TaskState' at 33, 43 and 55 but not at 48. A binder-side
order can't know that; it would need counting at the checker's first resolution of each name (tsc's actual model).
Also not covered: arrow bodies whose return expressions inference checks early (getReturnTypeFromBody of a
context-sensitive argument), and JavaScript files (resolved serially, counted in walk order).
