# Triage
Uninvestigated items. Triage sessions drain this.

- readme.md says development is halted and describes the project as "Tess"'s; refresh it.
- Catalogue the ~60 PERF/HACK/TODO/FIXME comments in `src/` into hacks.md (smaller-model sub-agent job).
- AGENTS.md is a byte-identical copy of CLAUDE.md; make one a symlink or note which is canonical so they don't drift.
- Parser: no tokenizer + backtracking with fail cache. Fine for speed in principle, but check parse-error fidelity
  against tsc (the errors baseline includes syntax errors) and worst-case behaviour once plan 00's bench exists.
- `engine.c` (JS interpreter, 634 lines): is it used by the checker (const enum / literal evaluation?) or dead
  weight? Remove if unused.
- Does `./test.sh` (valgrind) currently run clean on a sample? Unknown after the cleat port.
- Perf (from `./bench.sh`, see `measurements.md`): ~25% of tttt's wall time is outside the four timed phases,
  presumably `program_destroy` freeing node by node. A real CLI should just exit; long term, arenas.
- Perf: peak RSS is ~120 bytes per source byte (500 MB for a 4 MB corpus), worse than tsgo. AST node size / per-node
  allocations / `DEBUG_ALLOCATOR` (always defined in `prelude.h`, even in release; adds a header word per allocation
  and a counter) are the suspects. Measure with it off.
- Perf: `resolve names` costs as much as parsing (92 ms vs 88 ms on the bench corpus). Surprising for a phase that
  should be a hash lookup per identifier; look for per-scope allocation or linear scans.
- The bench corpus is weak (easy passing tests x200 copies in namespaces). Replace with a real project as soon as
  tttt can get through one without parse errors.
- Harness runs a test twice when the first run leaves net allocations (lib cache fill), 173 times per suite run. Fine,
  but it means "### TEST" markers / log output can repeat; `failstats.py` dedupes.
- `failstats.py` counts by test *name*; a handful of names exist in both `compiler/` and `conformance/`, so its pass
  counts can differ from the harness by one or two. The harness has the same collision in `baseline_results.ts`.
- Checking the stdlib itself (`tttt --no-lib --keep-going thirdparty/lib/esnext.full.d.ts`) gives 32 name errors and
  143 type errors; tsc gives none. Cheap regression target for lib-related bugs (Intl namespace merging,
  `globalThis.`).
- tttt's `main.c` only loads 4 lib files and ignores tsconfig; `error.c` "Error added with invalid span" fires ~1.4k
  times per suite run, mostly duplicate-identifier / redeclare errors whose other declaration is in a lib.
