# Triage
Uninvestigated items: dump here what you don't want to deal with now. Triage sessions drain this into `bugs/*.md`,
plans, or fixes.

Last drained 2026-10-07 (triage session, todo entry 10 of the tenth window; suite 13299 -> 13303, 0 lost, every
corpus unchanged, sweep 8588 -> 8589, flagflip 51 / 47 / 11 -> 51 / 45 / 10, `$ExpectType` 68619 flat). Four Opus
sub-agents (type core + corpus cells, missing checks, display/text, JS/modules) took every item: 44 fixes, ~12 items
gone by earlier work, the rest written up into bugs/*.md, plan 26 Leftovers and hacks.md. Fresh mutation runs: seed 4
(`/tmp/tc-mutate4`, 26 -> 21) and seed 5 (`/tmp/tb-mutate`, 29 -> 25), leftovers in missing_checks.md.

- valibot under the commit's tsc with `--ignoreDeprecations 6.0` (without it tsc skips semantic diagnostics after the
  TS5107): 26 TS2554 "Expected 1 arguments, but got 0" on `expectTypeOf<...>().toEqualTypeOf<...>()` in
  `src/methods/partial/partial.test-d.ts` and others, i.e. tsc 6 finds types unequal that tttt finds equal (before and
  after stable ordering). Missing-diagnostic lead for plan 48 stage 5 (valibot re-pin), 2026-10-07.
- typeofImportDefer (plan 48 stage 3, agent B): `typeof import.defer("./a").Foo` in a type: tsc's parseImportType recovery says '(' expected at the `.`, TS1141 over `.defer`, ')' expected at `(`, then TS2339 'Foo' on '"./a"'; tttt says TS2304 'import'. One test, quirky recovery.
